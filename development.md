# Application Overview

Project Requirement Document

Project Title: Numerology Examination Web Application

1. Overview

The Numerology Examination Web Application is a web-based testing platform designed for students who have completed a numerology course. The platform enables students to take a test assessing their numerology knowledge without requiring login or data storage.

Upon test completion, students will receive a summary of their performance, and if they pass, a certificate will be generated and emailed to the course teacher/admin. Failed students can immediately retake the exam.

2. Application Components

The application consists of two main components:

Student Examination Interface â€“ Where students take the test.

Admin Panel (Back Office) â€“ Where administrators manage questions and test settings.

3. Detailed Feature Breakdown (Story Points)

3.1 Student Examination Flow

[x] Set up frontend structure for student examination interface using Nuxt 3.

[ ] Create a start page with instructions and a button to begin the exam.

[ ] Develop a question-fetching API to retrieve a predefined number of questions from Supabase.

[ ] Implement random question selection from the database.

[ ] Display one question at a time with multiple-choice options.

[ ] Implement next and previous navigation for answering questions.

[ ] Develop a submit button that finalizes answers and calculates the score.

[ ] Create a result page showing the number of correct and incorrect answers.

[ ] Implement Pass/Fail logic based on predefined scoring criteria.

[ ] Display detailed answer review for students (showing correct/incorrect responses).

[ ] Implement a retry button for failed students to retake the test immediately.

[ ] Ensure no login or data storage is required for examinees.

3.2 Admin Panel (Back Office)

[ ] Implement Supabase Auth for admin login.

[ ] Create an admin dashboard using Nuxt 3.

[ ] Develop CRUD operations for exam questions (create, read, update, delete).

[ ] Create a form interface for adding/editing questions.

[ ] Develop a database schema in Supabase for storing questions.

[ ] Implement pass/fail criteria settings in the admin panel.

[ ] Allow admins to set the number of questions per test dynamically.

[ ] Enable certificate template customization within the admin panel.

[ ] Develop an interface for email settings configuration.

[ ] Create an exam history log (optional) to store past exam results.

3.3 Email & Certificate Generation

[ ] Implement email sending logic using Supabase Functions or an external API.

[ ] Generate a PDF certificate using Puppeteer.

[ ] Design a certificate template with placeholders for student names and scores.

[ ] Store generated certificates in Supabase Storage.

[ ] Provide a certificate download link on the result page.

[ ] Ensure successful students' certificates are emailed to the teacher/admin.
